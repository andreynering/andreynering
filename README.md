Hi, I'm Andrey, a Senior Software Engineer from Joinville, Santa Catarina,
Brazil. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

I'm a passionate for Open Source and a generalist.
I like to learn and work with many different technologies, tools, languages and
databases.

I'm currently working at [Charm][charm] hacking all kind of developer tools,
with a strong focus on TUIs and CLIs, mostly using [Go][go].

I'm also the creator of [Task][task] and [testfixtures][testfixtures], and a
fan of [Ruby on Rails][rails] for back-end web dev.
