Hi, I'm Andrey, a Senior Software Engineer from Joinville, Santa Catarina,
Brazil. üáßüá∑

Professionally, I have a decade of experience with [Ruby on Rails][rails],
[Go][go], and web development in general.
Although I really like to work with back-end tools, I also have experience with
JavaScript, in particular with React.

As an open source lover, I did some small
[contributions to Ruby on Rails][railscontributions] in the past
(in special improvements to the [Rails Guides][railsguides]) and to other
small projects.

I also created some Go projects, like:

- [Task][task] ([since 2017](https://github.com/go-task/task/commit/39e60d6278648d0e02c2bca830ad63cacbf60538), [9k ‚≠ê](https://star-history.com/#go-task/task)):
  a simple automation tool that can be used to automate boring tasks related to
  development, testing, deployment and more. Written in [Go][go].
- [testfixtures][testfixtures] ([since 2016](https://github.com/go-testfixtures/testfixtures/commit/cd0d0838e5f07eda645a05ee1824e29763fdf434), [1k ‚≠ê](https://star-history.com/#go-testfixtures/testfixtures)):
  a Go package that allows one to write automated tests that connects to a real
  relational (SQL) database. Useful for writting integration tests.
