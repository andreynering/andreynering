Hi, I'm Andrey, a Senior Software Engineer from Brazil. :brazil:

Professionally, I have a decade of experience with Ruby on Rails and web
development in general. Although I really like to work with back-end tools, I
also have experience with JavaScript, in particular with React. Read more about
my experience on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreynering/).

I have a passion for open source and have done small contributions to many
projects throughout the years, in Ruby, Go, and JavaScript. Between the projects
I created myself, two are worth mentioning:

* Task ([Website](https://taskfile.dev/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/go-task/task) | 8k :star:):
  a general purporse task runner for developers.
* testfixtures ([GitHub](https://github.com/go-testfixtures/testfixtures) | 900 :star:):
  a library to allow writting integration tests with a real SQL database in Go.

If you find my work useful you may want to sponsor me through
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/andreynering/).
