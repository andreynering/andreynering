Hi, I'm Andrey, a Senior Software Engineer from Joinville, Santa Catarina,
Brazil. üáßüá∑

Professionally, I have a decade of experience with [Ruby on Rails][rails],
[Go][go], and web development in general.
Although I really like to work with back-end tools, I also have experience with
JavaScript, in particular with React.

## Open Source

As an open source lover, I did some small
[contributions to Ruby on Rails][railscontributions] in the past
(in special improvements to the [Rails Guides][railsguides]) and to other
small projects.

I also created some Go projects, like:

- [Task][task] ([since 2017](https://github.com/go-task/task/commit/39e60d6278648d0e02c2bca830ad63cacbf60538), [9k ‚≠ê](https://star-history.com/#go-task/task)):
  a simple automation tool that can be used to automate boring tasks related to
  development, testing, deployment and more. Written in [Go][go].
- [testfixtures][testfixtures] ([since 2016](https://github.com/go-testfixtures/testfixtures/commit/cd0d0838e5f07eda645a05ee1824e29763fdf434), [1k ‚≠ê](https://star-history.com/#go-testfixtures/testfixtures)):
  a Go package that allows one to write automated tests that connects to a real
  relational (SQL) database. Useful for writting integration tests.

## Work

### [JobScore][jobscore] (2018-Current)

JobScore is an applicant tracking system built as a "classic" monolith Rails
application, using PostgreSQL as its database system and React as the shiny
front-end framework of choice. ~6 years is a lot, so I had the chance to help on
many different projects.

Highlights:

- I led the upgrade Rails in the big monolith from 4.2 to its latest version
  (7.1 currently). I am also the main person resposible to review Dependabot
  PRs for back-end (Ruby, Rails) dependencies.
- I helped to improve the billing system, including introducing annual plans.
- I helped to overhaul the "platform integrations" infrastructure, which is the
  Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 integrations with JobScore including
  calendar integration, email synchronization, SSO, and more.
- I also worked some partner integrations, like with Indeed ([Gold Partner](https://www.indeed.com/hire/ats-integration/ats-partners?co=US)),
  LinkedIn ([Gold Partners](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/ats-partners?selectedFilter=all))
  and others.
- I helped to build the recent ["v2" public API](https://developer.jobscore.com/),
  which also includes webhooks and an integration with
  [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/jobscore/integrations).
- I participated in the process to convert many pages from the 1990-like
  "HTML generated in back-end + jQuery" style to a brand new and modern SPA
  built in React and using a proper design system and multiple themes.

### Sardo (2013-2017)

My first job, in this tiny and local consultancy company (now closed) I had the
opportunity to learn and work with Ruby on Rails, Go and other tools, and got a
great experience working with many different database systems (mostly PostgreSQL
and Microsoft SQL Server).

## Education

- (2012-2015) Bachelor in Information Systems in the University of State of Santa Catarina
  (UDESC) in S√£o Bento do Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil.
